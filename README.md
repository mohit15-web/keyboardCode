# Generate Keyboard Code

This project displays the numerical code corresponding to the key pressed on the keyboard. It provides a simple interface to see the key and its corresponding Unicode value.

## How it Works

The project uses JavaScript to capture the keydown event and display the key and its Unicode value in the browser. It leverages the `charCodeAt()` method to get the Unicode value of the pressed key.

## Usage

To use the project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Press any key on your keyboard, and you'll see the key and its corresponding Unicode value displayed on the screen.
